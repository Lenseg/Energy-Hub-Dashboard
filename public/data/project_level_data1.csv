5331,84488,Angola Charcoal,"The Project aims to introduce energy-efficient charcoal technologies in Angola and trigger market demand for certified, sustainable charcoal. Through selected Responsible Partners, energy-efficient charcoal kilns, briquetting machines and efficient stoves will be transferred to rural and peri-urban beneficiaries, thereby adding value along the chain while creating opportunities for income and job creation. Environmental benefits are attained by mitigation of baseline greenhouse gas emissions, reduction of local pollution, and saving of forest-based biomass resources. The Project will deliver key elements for building and financing a sustainable charcoal sector, including a policy white paper and sustainability criteria and verification mechanisms. The Project will further build relevant human resources at all levels for implementing and sustaining low-emission development strategies in Angola, with a focus on charcoal and rural biomass utilization.

It will develop technical standards and quality criteria as input for regulation and the design of demonstration pilots. Capacity building in the field of urban planning is addressed by fostering international partnerships and inter-sectorial working groups. The expected fuel savings (43,666 GJ annually) will benefit approx. 50,000 individuals (m/f: 40%/60%) and translates into fiscal budget savings of US$ 1.27 mln annually. EE measures by municipalities will translate into annual electricity savings (3,776 MWh annually) and budget savings of US$ 640,000.

5452,,Sustainable Cities: Ashgabat and Awaza,"Population growth and economic development have led to rapid expansion of cities in Turkmenistan over the past two decades, most notably in the capital city of Ashgabat and the resort zone of Awaza on the Caspian Sea.  This growth has had an increasing negative environmental impact – resource consumption, waste, local air and water pollution, and emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG).  Ashgabat and Awaza have already embraced some measures to manage this impact.  But there remains much untapped technical potential to decrease the volume and impact of private vehicle traffic in all cities, further expand efficient street lighting, reduce waste and increase recycling, and introduce “green” practices to hotels. 
The development challenge of the project is to measurably reduce the negative impacts of urban growth in Turkmenistan while also advancing social and economic development goals.  To this end, the project will provide technical assistance, institutional and policy support, organization and development of programs, and promotion of behavioral change, all in conjunction with national priorities and specific needs articulated by the Government.  Measures introduced in Ashgabat and Awaza will yield significant GHG emissions reductions and social benefits in themselves, while also creating a basis for replication elsewhere in Turkmenistan.",Turkmenistan,RBEC,,,,"6,060,046",,,,,,,,,,

The Kingdom has recently submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to UNFCCC.  With international support, Morocco has committed to cutting its GHG emissions by 32% by 2030.  This project falls within the framework of the national strategy of large-scale development of renewables in Morocco which advocates for sustainable energy sources, the industrial integration of clean technologies, and the creation of green jobs.   This strategy strives for mitigating GHG emissions associated with the use of fossil energies by reaching a target of 42% installed capacity of renewable in the national grid by 2020.  The project is also informed by the objectives of the Green Morocco Plan (GMP) which aims at developing a sustainable agriculture by, inter alia, the rational use of resources and recourse to drip irrigation practices.  The present project aims to promote the take-up of PV-powered drip irrigation pumping systems in Morocco by creating a conducive framework for the implementation of the national programme; strengthening the capacities of the various actors concerned; supporting awareness raising  of operators and  farmers on the economic and environmental benefits of solar pumping; putting in place financing mechanisms to facilitate the acquisition of PV pumping systems; standardizing solar installations for irrigation; and implementing a monitoring framework to track project impacts  as regards GHG emission reductions.

5569,,FREAGER,"Brief project description: PNG’s greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction efforts to date have focused on the forestry sector. Yet, despite low per capita energy use at present, with only 15 percent of the population having access to electricity, the adoption of renewable energy (RE) and energy efficiency (EE) technologies in PNG has strong potential both to reduce current GHG emissions and avoid future, growing GHG emissions expected as rising per capita energy use and electrification accompany development of the nation. Analysis shows that community RE mini-grid and township diesel center based EE programs present particularly compelling win-win propositions for PNG. Over time, both will present substantial cost savings over the business-as-usual case, in which diesel is used, while at the same time lowering present or avoiding future GHG emissions. FREAGER will demonstrate the relevant technologies for and aim to achieve widespread replication of micro/mini-hydro mini-grids, solar PV mini-grids, and township EE programs. It will aim to do so by removing barriers to these technologies in the areas of policy and planning, technical and commercial viability, availability of financing, and information and awareness. In the policy and planning area, the project will promote these technologies via: capacity building programs for officials, through which the officials develop actual pipeline RE mini-grid projects and township EE programs; design of policy incentives; standards work; national roadmaps for community RE mini-grids and township EE programs; and provincial level RE and EE plans. Technical and commercial viability will be supported through capacity building for technical personnel on RE mini-grids and on building and industrial EE. It will also be supported through developing and disseminating information on best international sourcing channels for EE and RE and on the “honest,” best costing for community RE mini-grids in PNG. Project demos will include two mini-hydro mini-grids and one PV mini-grid, with support also provided for productive use of RE at all three sites. In addition, demos of comprehensive EE programs (including building and industrial energy audits and retrofits, support for residential customers, support for future, large power customers, and street lighting retrofits) will be developed in two townships that are fully powered by diesel. The project will also support demonstration of PPAs and billing systems, as well as O&M training, for two mini-hydro projects that are already under development. Efforts related to financing EE and RE will include capacity building for the financial sector and the set-up of an ESCO fund to finance EE retrofits and a loan fund for community RE projects. Information and awareness work will include support to develop domestic manufacturing of RE mini-grid and EE products (and thus achieve lower cots) and briefings on the cost competitiveness of RE and EE as compared to diesel. It will further include a multi-channel media campaign for RE and EE and educational materials on RE and EE. It will also include RE mini-grid how-to handbooks tailored to PNG, pipeline RE mini-grid project listings, data from RE resource assessments, and curriculum from various project workshops, all available at a one-stop-shop website on RE and EE in PNG.",Papua New Guinea,RBAP,,,,"2,840,640",,,,,,,,,,
